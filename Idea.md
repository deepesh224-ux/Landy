## Project: Landy (Small Landlord & Tenant Portal)
# Core Concept
# A full-cycle "PropTech" platform that handles property discovery (Marketplace) and ongoing management (Maintenance/Payments) using a unique Property Code system for security and onboarding.
## 📱 1. The Tenant Journey
* Screen A: The Public Marketplace
* Feature: Browse available listings.
* Options: Filter by price, location, and amenities.
* Action: "Apply Now" button to send a digital profile to the landlord.
* Screen B: The Onboarding (Your Image)
* Feature: "Join Your Home" portal.
* Action: Tenant enters the 6-digit Property Code generated by the landlord.
* Benefit: Instantly links the tenant to the specific property data, chat, and lease.
* Screen C: The Tenant Dashboard
* Maintenance: Submit "Ticket" with photo, description, and urgency (Low, Normal, Emergency).
* Finances: View rent due dates and a "Pay Now" button (Stripe).
* Chat: Private messaging thread with the landlord.
* Documents: View digital lease and move-in inspection photos.
## 🖥️ 2. The Landlord Journey
* Screen A: The Portfolio Overview
* Feature: Card-based view of all properties.
* Options: Toggle properties between "Private" (Managed) and "Public" (For Rent).
* Stats: High-level view of total monthly rent collected and open tickets.
* Screen B: Property Deep-Dive (Specific Section)
* When a landlord clicks a property (e.g., 742 Evergreen Terrace), they see:
* Maintenance Kanban: Drag-and-drop tickets from New ➔ Assigned ➔ Resolved.
* Tenant Management: List of linked tenants; ability to Reset Property Code or remove a tenant.
* Financials: Expense logs (repairs, utilities) for tax reporting.
* Chat Center: Property-specific messaging history.
